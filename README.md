# Hindi-Word-Clock
A word clock is a type of clock that displays the time using words rather than numbers. 
Instead of using traditional clock hands or digital numbers, a word clock uses a grid of 
letters that light up to spell out the current time in words. 
The first word clocks were developed in the early 2000s, and they quickly gained 
popularity as a stylish and elegant alternative to traditional clocks. They are often 
appreciated for their simplicity, elegance, and the way they present time in a more 
intuitive and natural way.
